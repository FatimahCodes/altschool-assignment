    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Bauchi town of Bauchi state Nigeria, <br />
      where a natural curiosity for how things work was evident from a <br />
      youngage. Growing up with the passion of strong affinity for mathematics
      <br />
      and science led me to pursue a Degree (Mechatronics and System
      Engineering) <br />
      at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, where i graduated with honors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by the rapid advancements in technology and the integral role
      <br />
      that software plays in everyday life, I decided to join a <br />
      Alt school. The decision stemmed from a desire to not just use <br />
      technology, but to understand and create it. I recognized <br />
      that programming is a foundational skill in todayâ€™s digital world and
      <br/>
      saw it as an opportunity to build solutions that can have a real-world
      impact
    </p>
    <p>
      In joining the School of Engineering, I aim to deepen my knowledge <br />
      of software development and engineering principles. I am particularly
      interested <br />
      in backend engineering. The goal is to acquire the technical expertise
      necessary <br />
      to innovate and contribute to cutting-edge projects. Ultimately, I aspires
      to become a <br />
      skilled engineer who can lead projects that solve complex problems and
      improve lives through technology.
